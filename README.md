Project made in IT Talents training camp
During my final training module in the IT Talents Training Camp on Web Development, I successfully collaborated with a team member to make a project that involved the creation of a RESTful Web API which allows searching for builders by repair category or posting offers related to proposed repairs . The project was developed using Java with the Spring Boot framework and utilized a MySQL database.
We designed and implemented a web api that consists of five main entities: users, posts, applications, repair categories and comments. We developed the following functionalities for each entity:
-Users(client, builder,admin)- register, login, logout, edit, delete, add rating, add repair_category, upload photo, retrieve user by ID, by repair_category and retrieve all users
-Posts- add, edit, delete, retrieve post by user_id
-Applications-add, edit, delete, accept, retrieve all applications per post
-Comments- add, edit, delete, get by sender_id
-Repair_Categories- add, edit, delete, retrieve all
